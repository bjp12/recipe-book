# Recipe Book

My friends and I love to cook and people are always asking us for our recipes! 
I created this recipe book as a way to easily access our recipes without having to scroll through boring side stories and process pictures. 

Some features implemented so far:
  * Build a grocery list by clicking on items you need to go get. Once you click build, this list will be copied to your clipboard so that you can easily text or email it to yourself.
  * Use the menu builder to try out different options for appetizers, entr√©es, desserts and drinks to design an entire meal with our recipes.
  * Use the search bar to find specific recipes.
  * Find recipes using ingredients you already have!
 
Coming Soon:
  * Process pictures and step by step instructions when you search for a specific recipe
  * More recipes!
  
Let me know what else you would like to see!
