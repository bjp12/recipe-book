			<h3>Bijal Patel</h3>
			<p>I am a senior at UC Berkeley studying computer science. Living on my own made me realize I needed to learn how to make quick, healthy meals. So, I started an instagram account called cookingwithbijal to document the recipes I came up with. During my free time, I started cooking larger meals and wanted to create a space where I could share these recipes with everyone. Along with cooking, I also enjoy teaching. Currently, I am teaching computer science to young kids.</p>
